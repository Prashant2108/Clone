This small project is very much inspired by piano. I was very much fascinated by piano during my childhood. I used to wonder how is it possible that a sound could be generated on a single press of the key. 
This idea came into my mind and I used my coding knowledge to create a clone of piano that would even display a new circle with different color every time the key is being pressed. 
I have used two new libraries of JS in this project paper.js (for animation) and howler.js (for audio).
